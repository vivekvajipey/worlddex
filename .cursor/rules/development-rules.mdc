# Development Rules for WorldDex App

## Code Style
- Keep code concise and clean - prefer short, readable functions and components
- Avoid excessive commenting - code should be self-documenting where possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names that explain their purpose

## Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS exclusively for all styling needs
- Never use inline styles (style={{}})
- Never create separate CSS/SCSS stylesheets
- Follow utility-first approach with Tailwind's composable classes

## Component Structure
- Create small, reusable components
- Follow single-responsibility principle
- Keep component nesting to a reasonable depth
- Use TypeScript for type safety

## React/React Native Best Practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders (use memoization when appropriate)
- Properly handle async operations and loading states
- Structure folders by feature rather than by type when applicable

## Performance
- Optimize imports to reduce bundle size
- Lazy load components when appropriate
- Properly handle and clean up subscriptions/listeners
